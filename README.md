# React Evaluation - Codeable 🎯

## 📌 Description

This project is my final evaluation for the **Advanced Frontend Module** at Codeable. I developed a fully functional React + TypeScript application based on a **Figma design**, implementing key frontend concepts like **state management, component reusability, API integration, and authentication**.

> **Note:** Some functionalities were pre-implemented as part of the bootcamp curriculum, but I worked on key areas such as frontend logic, API integration, and state management.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **React.js** ⚛️
- **TypeScript** 🦕
- **Vite** ⚡
- **Context API**
- **CSS Modules** 🎨
- **Git & GitHub** 🛠
- **Vercel** 🚀

## 📌 API Integration

The project uses a **RESTful API** hosted on **Railway** for user authentication and task management. Tasks are **stored in a remote database** and retrieved via API calls.
